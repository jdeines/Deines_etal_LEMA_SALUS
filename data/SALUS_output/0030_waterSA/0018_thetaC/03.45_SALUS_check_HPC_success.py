# This script looks at the scratch directory and checks if all the results (each state, chunk, and scenario) exist.
# It also checks to see if the log file end with "completed" or has been stopped unexpectedly with some error. 
# if the result does not exist or does not have the correct variables or the run stopped unexpectedly, 
#   then qsub <name>.sh is written to the bat file redoRuns.bat
